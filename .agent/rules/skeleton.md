 --- ## **Key Principles for Universal Note-Taking:** | Principle | Application | |-----------|-------------| | **Hierarchy** | Headers organize content logically | | **Trackability** | Checkboxes + dates + status = progress | | **Connection** | Link related concepts internally | | **Retrieval** | Tables + tags make searching easy | | **Simplification** | Explain in your own words always | | **Evidence** | Include code examples & results | | **Repetition** | Built-in review schedule | | **Flexibility** | Remove/add sections as needed | --- ## **How to Use This System:** 1. **During Learning:** Fill in definitions, code examples, confusions 2. **After Practice:** Document what went wrong and why 3. **Weekly:** Review & link connections to other topics 4. **Monthly:** Update progress tracker & identify gaps 5. **Before Exam/Interview:** Use quiz section for quick recall --- ## **Pro Tips:** ✅ **Use Templates** - Copy this structure for every new topic ✅ **Consistent Format** - Makes notes searchable & organized ✅ **Visual Cues** - Emojis & colors help quick scanning ✅ **Version Control** - Keep notes in Git for history ✅ **Interlinks** - Use `[Link to Topic](./topic.md)` for navigation ✅ **Searchable Tags** - Add `#subject #difficulty #status` at end ✅ **Review Regularly** - Notes are useless if not reviewed ✅ **Teach Others** - Best way to validate understanding This system works for **AWS, DSA, Coding, Math, Languages, or ANY subject**! Want me to create a specific template for DSA or Coding that follows this structure?
